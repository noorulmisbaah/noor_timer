About The Project
#######################
Thank you for taking a visit into my repository.
Noor Timer Application is a web based application the looks much like a stopwatch. Users can add timers, give a timer a title and a description, update the timer title and/or it's description, and also delete a timer. It is a fullstack application. This means that timers are saved on the server and retrieved when the user signs in. A new user will have to create an account first before accessing the interface of the application. Users who have an account will have to sign in first before having access to the interface, too.
Comments can be added and viewed in the application. Furthermore, users can update their account information and delete their account if whey wish.
The application is built with a customized menu. Instead of the regular JavaScript alert function for showing notifications, the application has it's own customized notification box for showing notifications.
